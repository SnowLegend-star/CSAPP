Testing mm malloc
Reading tracefile: short1-bal.rep
Checking mm_malloc for correctness, efficiency, and performance.

Results for mm malloc:
trace  valid  util     ops      secs  Kops
 0       yes   66%      12  0.000000 24000
Total          66%      12  0.000000 24000

Perf index = 40 (util) + 40 (thru) = 80/100
